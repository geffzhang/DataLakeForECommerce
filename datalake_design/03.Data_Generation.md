# 3. Data Generation

## 3.1 Real world scenario
Normally, the business transaction data and user behavior data are all generated by the e-commerce website or mobile app.
For example, if user click a button, the action will trigger the onClick() logic of the website, and the onClick() logic
will send relevant information to the logging server.

Normally it's the front-end engineer who is responsable for implementing this logic. 

In general the log data contains following information:
- current page 
- action 
- error 
- common (e.g. device info, browser info, gps location, etc)

## 3.2 Log upload frequency

As we explained before, one action (e.g. click a button, scroll a page) will generate one log message. We have two 
strategies to upload these logs:
1. We upload the log message to the logging server when an action occurs
   - pros: all actions are logged in real time
   - cons: heavy network IO.
2. We group the log message and sent them together when a specific actions occurs. In general, we use the leave page 
   action to trigger the upload. In other words, all action logs of one page are grouped together, and they are uploaded
   when user leave the page.
   - pros: low network IO.
   - cons: action logs are not updated in real time.
   
## 3.3 Dummy data generation

As we don't have the website and mobile app to generate data, we will write some scripts to generate data for us.
